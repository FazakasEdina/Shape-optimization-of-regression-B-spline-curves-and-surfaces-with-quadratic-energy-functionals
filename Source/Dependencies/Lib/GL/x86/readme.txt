About the OpenGL Extension Library (GLEW)
-----------------------------------------
These dynamically and statically linkable function libraries 
have been generated for 32-bit Windows platforms, by using 
the compiler of the Community Edition of the Microsoft Visual 
Studio 2019. (This is important, since the latest version of
the Community Edition of the Qt SDK was also generated by
using this compiler.)
